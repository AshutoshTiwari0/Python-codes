GIL-> Global interpreter lock 
python has gil which makes sure that only a single thread runs at a given time.



concurrency and parallelism

concurrency-> Two things can happen at same time
example-> a program is importing a library and also getting an api request at same time

parallelism-> Running at same time


diff between asynchronous and threading

asynchronous-> it knows when to switch. like sleep(5ms) so switch to a new task after 5ms 
threading-> it does not know when to switch it will depend on os scheduler.
